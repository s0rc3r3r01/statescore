# statescore
Statefulness Scoring Application
Developed as proof of concept , this is a stateful Node.JS application.
It is intended to be deployed as base image, it will be used as a test for the degree of statefulness of a containerized
system.
It will run on one or multiple Docker engines and will graphically show detailed information
about the past state available: from the local storage, from the remote storage or the local memory
and will check the information available from other instances running in the same cluster.
